        We started long ago by trading on the stock exchange and was always looking for opportunities to automate our trading. With the rapid growth of crypto exchanges, manual trading has become even more unpredictable.   
        Advanced traders know about services where you can create your own trading strategy and automate it with a robot. We tried to trade through them, but there is a problem that these robots have a very limited functionality. So in order to really control your trading, you need a tailor-made solution developed from scratch. 
        That's how and why we created Cryptuoso - a service for automated cryptocurrency trading. Our robots use advanced strategies and do not require users to have any programming skills.
        We shared our service with our friends, and they convinced us that Cryptuoso should be useful for other crypto-enthusiasts - both for beginners and experienced traders.
        We are warmly welcome you in the community of a product created by traders and for traders.`
